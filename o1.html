                    A while back I wrote about debugging an issue on mobile armed only with an error counter and referrer information. Thankfully I’m pleased to report that we are now tracking and fixing client side JavaScript errors for Wikimedia wikis which is providing more error-free experiences to our end users. In this blog post I wanted to document what led us to prioritizing it; how we went about implementing a solution; and what we learned from the experience. If you are planning to log client errors in your own project, you may find the summarizing section at the end of the article useful.

We were diving into a large technical project with no knowledge of the existing landscape in which we were working in. In fact much of our code hadn’t been touched in some time. In addition to this our mobile error counting had also jumped from 10k a minute to 40k a minute with no obvious cause¹ signally we had introduced a bug somewhere. It was clear to the developers tasked with this work, that sophisticated error handling was a requirement for this project.

                            Before I even got involved in the work, there was an amazing collaboration between the security, performance, operations, analytics and product infrastructure to get everything in place. This effort is tracked on our public task management system for those that are interested in the details.

                            Thanks to the collaboration and planning of these teams, the code for catching errors and sending them to the server ended up being relatively small.

                                 To roll out further, we had to ensure that bugs were getting fixed, information we didn’t care about from user gadgets and scripts did not drown the signals we got from more important errors and most importantly the traffic to the end point was low such that it wouldn’t bring down our services.
                                 <br>
                                 We started small on a small wiki for the software that runs our sites: 
                                 <a href="https://mediawiki.org/">
                                    MediaWiki.org.

                                 </a> 
                                 From a product perspective, even though the audience was low, it gave us a hint about what to expect as we rolled out further. The errors logged were a good way to capture very prominent errors e.g. errors occurring on every page view. Many of these errors had very actionable stack traces meaning we could file bugs and fix them, which we did, however others were more cryptic. 
                                 <a href="https://sentry.io/answers/javascript-script-error/">
                                    "Script error.”
                                </a>
                                  was one of the most prominent and the most unclear to fix.

                                  <br>

                                  The reason we were getting “Script error” was due to the fact that code was being loaded from across our websites. Many of our users were loading gadgets from other wikis. So while this could it be explained, it was not very actionable without a stack trace. However, it did provide the file which caused the error which could be linked to the associated wiki page. Similar <a href="https://jdlrobson.com/posts/2019-02-11_we-re-going-on-a-bug-hunt--we-re-not-scared---b4057e4a91d2">to my bug hunting adventures in my previous blog post,</a>
                                   it could be used to manually reproduce those errors in exploratory testing.

                                    <br>
                                    However, the errors we were seeing on <a href="https://mediawiki.org/">
                                        MediaWiki.org 
                                    </a>
                                    represented a small drop in a large ocean of errors for our projects. Despite the rate of errors for these smaller wikis being sufficiently low, we knew that there were more errors out there waiting to be explored, the kind that only come from really stretching the use our software — for example editing a wiki page with complicated markup or copying and pasting a table with thousands of rows! We needed to roll out to larger wikis to help prioritize bug fixing in our product work flow by identifying where in our complex code ecosystem our users were commonly hitting problems in our code. But where to begin?
                                    <br>
                                    <img width="600" height="400" src="2.png" alt="picture "/>
                                    <br>
                                    We looked at traffic first to guide us. We wanted wikis bigger than our current wikis, but not too big. 
                                    <a href="https://jdlrobson.com/posts/2019-02-11_we-re-going-on-a-bug-hunt--we-re-not-scared---b4057e4a91d2">

                                     we were able to get guesstimates of the actual error rates on mobile for possible wikis by looking at referrer traffic. Combining this information with the actual error rates being ingested for Hawaiian Wikipedia and MediaWiki.org for all our traffic and the traffic for all our wikis, we were able to predict the volume of errors for our candidate wikis on desktop too. We choose a wiki which would inform us more about the errors our users were actually facing without overwhelming our event platform.

                                        Running the client side error tracking on Catalan Wikipedia was really helpful for prioritizing roll out. Due to the larger volume of traffic we went from around 2,000 errors a day to 40,000, however this taught us a lot. Certain errors we were seeing in the same software on our smaller websites were now occurring more frequently which helped us prioritize them.

                                    What became apparent however was certain errors were being repeated by a single IP. We hadn’t been able to notice that with such low traffic. At one point 38,830 of 48,175 errors in a 12 hr period logged to Catalan Wikipedia came from a single IP address who was running some badly maintained gadgets that they had included almost a decade ago.

                                    With errors limited, the list of errors was much more manageable, however it was clear that many of the stack traces were not useful. In certain cases, the code was clearly coming from places outside of our control. Interestingly we also saw a lot of bugs from browser extensions and non-Wikimedia domains — 
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate">Google Translate </a>
                                    for example and browser extensions like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">
                                        GreaseMonkey

                                     that allow the running of locally written JavaScript. Some of these errors did not have any information about stack traces or the source of the error. The noise of this unfortunately made it difficult to identify real errors, so we decided to exclude any errors without information on their origin.

                                      We however decided to defer the filtering of browser extensions and non-wikimedia sites as this could be taken care of using logstash filtering if needed and it was useful to know,

                                       The end users for the MediaWiki.org and Catalan Wikipedia were not fully representative of all our users so a logic next step was to enable bug tracking on one of our larger language projects written in a right to left text script. Hebrew was an obvious choice, as the community there had previously volunteered for

                                        to help us catch errors before they reach production meaning if we saw client errors there we would have time to block the bug before it could impact other projects.
                                        <br>
                                        When we enabled the error tracking on Hebrew Wikipedia, the bump in errors was not as significant as it might have been. We didn’t learn much from this deployment, other than we were getting closer to the finish line. Sometimes a deployment just gives you the validation you need to continue.

                                        After this, we expanded coverage further to Wikimedia Commons, our site for uploading images. As we’ve rolled out further we’ve benefited more from our scale,

                                        Some errors are prefixed with “Uncaught” and some are not. For example,

                                            error TypeError: $submitButton.submitOnEnter is not a function

                                        is the same as

                                        </small>
                                         This meant that similar errors were not being grouped.

                                          The majority of the issues that we are now surfacing relate to user gadgets. User gadgets are an historic artifact of the wiki ecosystem that predates browser extensions which have allowed many editors to self-serve and many of our editors depend on them. Some of these 
                                          <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets#Usage">

                                          are defaulted to run for all users, including anonymous users, so we have to be careful that as we roll out further we address or communicate with our editors to get those fixes.

                                            We’ll continue this approach with further wikis, but this will take time.

                                          At the time of writing we are seeing about 60,000 errors a day from 10

                                          While hopefully obvious, one thing that’s important is that now we have the ability to identify client side errors that we use this information to fix bugs and to block deployments where necessary. Just adding the tool is not enough. This requires a lot of socializing the change, which is partly why I am writing this blog post. I have also started attending a weekly triage meeting and including consideration of these errors in our existing triaging processes. My hope is that all teams working on software for our projects will have a workflow for triaging and addressing such bugs without my assistance.

                                                Make sure your engineers have workflows for triaging new errors during and after deployments and ensure fixing and slowing down is part of your workflow.
